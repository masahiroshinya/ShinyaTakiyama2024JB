### How to run the simulation (post-hoc power analysis)

- Make sure that you have a Mathworks account. You can run the code with your free account. 
- Click the 'Open in Matlab Online' icon.
- Import the repository into your Matlab online.

- Input values of your research plan for the simulation:
  - Expected difference in variance
  - Number of trials
  - Number of subjects

  The screenshot is for independent-samples-design (i.e., comparison between different groups of subjects)

- Run the code and you will get the statistical power to detect a significant difference given the research plan.

The results suggest 88% of statistical power with the given parameters.
