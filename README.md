### How to run the simulation (post-hoc power analysis)

- Make sure that you have a Mathworks account. You can run the code with your free account. 
- Click the 'Open in Matlab Online' icon.
- Import the repository into your Matlab online.

- Input values of your research plan for the simulation:
  - Expected difference in variance
  - Number of trials
  - Number of subjects

Note: The screenshot is for independent-samples-design (i.e., comparison between different groups of subjects)

- Run the code and you will get the statistical power to detect a significant difference given the research plan.

Note: The results suggest 88% of statistical power with the given parameters.

### How to use this for your research and research paper.
Make sure to keep in mind the statistical power of your research plan.
Especially, when you observe a lack of statistical difference in variability measures, and if the estimated statistical power is too low, it means that the observed result could be false negative.  
We would recommend having 80+% of power based on the convention since Cohen (1988).

#### [fictional case study 1]
- Between-group design: patient vs. control
- 100 steps for each participant to calculate step variability (treadmill walking)
- 16 participants for each group
- Note that a 10% difference in SD/CV corresponds to a 1.21 times difference in variance.

- The result indicates 94% power.

[Examples of writing in your paper]
- Based on previous studies (whatever refs), we hypothesized that the difference in the step variability (CV of step length, width, and duration) would be 10%. According to a previous study (Shinya and Takiyama, 2024), we confirmed that our research plan (measuring 100 steps from 16 participants for each group) was capable of detecting a significant difference with 94% statistical power.
- Given the sufficient statistical power, the lack of difference in the step variability was worth discussing. 

#### [fictional case study 2]
- Within-subject design: normal vs. dual-task walk; pre- vs. post-intervention session
- 20 trials for each participant to calculate step variability
- 20 participants

- The results indicate that the research has a 91% power to detect a 20% difference in SD, but it has only a 40% power to detect a 10% difference.
  
[Examples of writing in your paper]
- We performed a simulation to estimate the statistical power of this research (Shinya and Takiyama, 2024). It suggested that our research has a 91% power to detect a 20% difference in SD, but it has only a 40% power to detect a 10% difference.
- We observed no significant difference in step variability between the normal and dual-task conditions. The results of numerical simulation (Shinya and Takiyama 2024) suggest that the lack of difference could be a false negative if the real effect of the dual-tasking was estimated as small as 10%. Further studies with collecting more steps would be needed to assess the potential effects.
